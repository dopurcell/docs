Some deployments of Prisma Cloud Compute are only provided the updated container images.
The supported and documented https://docs.twistlock.com/docs/compute_edition/upgrade/upgrade_process_self_hosted.html[upgrade process] requires the generation of new Console Deployment and Defender daemonSet yamls.
Every https://docs.twistlock.com/docs/releases/release-information/latest.html[release] of Prisma Cloud Compute we publish the tools necessary to update an existing deployment of Compute without requiring access to the support portal.
These tars files only contain the required tools to generate the new yamls.
